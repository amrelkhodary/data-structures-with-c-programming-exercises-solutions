The side quest folder includes code that i use to learn and expierement with features of the C language that are new to me
and that i encounter while solving the programming problems of each chapter, i put them out there just in case someone may be 
curious enough to look at them, but otherwise, you can skip them.


The side quests that I pursued here: 
1- Dynamic Memory Allocation (dynamic_mem_allocation.c)
2- Pointers and Arrays (pointers_and_arrays.c)
